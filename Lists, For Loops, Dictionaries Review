# len() is used to get the length of a list
# print(len(fav_movies))

# append() is used to add an item to the end of a list
fav_movies.append("Legally Blonde")

fav_movies.insert(3,"Flow")
print(fav_movies)

del(fav_movies[1])
print(fav_movies)

# FOR LOOPS

# looping 40 times and printing the number of the loop times 2
